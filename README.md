# Newsletter Web App
This react webapp creates an html newsletter from calendar data. 
- You can add single events or a whole excel file (it will use the first sheet) and skip through the single events to modify them.
- When the preview is at your gusto, just download the html file and your newsletter is ready to get spread all over the world.

I created this webapp with the help of bolt.new and chatGPT.
